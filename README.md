# How to run
In order for the whole application to work, you need to run the client and the server.

## Client side
More information can be found [here](/client/README.md).

## Server side
More information can be found [here](/server/README.md).

## When both frontend and backend is running in background...
You can now make server side actions via the client side UI. Navigate to API Testing. 

Note: POST and DELETE requests do not work well with demos like this, as our data is stored in a C# class and not in a database, causing our data to get wiped out every time we make a new call. Further development here depends on database implementation.
